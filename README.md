# Cootie-Catcher-Game
Directions for the project were provided by Professor Kim Murphy.
The purpose of this project is to mimick the game played by folding
a piece of paper in such a way that there are different answers beneath different
flaps with numbers and colors written on them.
I used basic classes and methods to implememnt this project.
